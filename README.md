# Personal and academic website

This is the code for [my personal webpage and blog](https://mario-bermonti.github.io/). I use this page for sharing my academic information and ideas. 

It is based on a template I developed for creating academic websites. You can [check it out here](https://github.com/mario-bermonti/academic-website-template). 

All feedback is welcome!
