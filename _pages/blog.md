## Welcome to my blog on using coding in cognitive research!

This blog is focused on how to use coding to facilitate research on cognition and learning. 

I will write posts teaching the basics of coding to get researchers new to coding started and present sotware tools that we build or use to facilitate the research process. I may ocassionally write posts about my research, research methods, open science, and data analysis.

Most of the entries will be short and long entries will be divided into series so they are easier to read and understand (and to write).
