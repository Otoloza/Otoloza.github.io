- title: "TEST: Response modality effects on spelling performance of elementary-school children"
  description:
    This is a cross-sectional study in its initial stages of development, which aims to examine the effects of the response modality on the spelling performance of Spanish-speaking elementary-school children. Fifty Spanish-speaking children from third grade and fourth grade will participate in this study. The participants will complete paper-and-pencil and computer versions of a spelling test. The keyboard proficiency and age will be included as covariates. This project is in its development stage.
