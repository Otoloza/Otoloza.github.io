My research has three main goals:
## Metal polluted white dwarfs.

I am curious about the fate of planetary systems after the evolution of the host star. Those planet(esimal)s that survive the evolution can end up on the white dwarfs left by the host stars. A fantastic process of dynamical disintegration produces a debris disc around the white dwarf, and this matter accretes onto the white dwarf polluting its self-cleaning atmosphere. A considerable fracion of white dwarfs (25-50%) show traces of metals, which they have demostrated a diverse nature on the composition of the planet(esimal)s out there, in the exo-planetary systems.

## Undestanding the evolution of interacting white dwarfs 
Close white dwarfs plus non-degenerate companions can interact via Roche lobe overflow of the non-degenerate
companion. As a consequence mass transfer occur and matter in accreted onto the white dwarfs. These systems are known as 
cataclysmic variables. I have a particular interest on the effects that accretion can have on the white dwarfs.
In a macro picture I am interested in understading the evolution of CVs since their progenitors (i.e. detached WD+MS systems called post common envelope binaries)
towards the future evolution and their outcomes (i.e. supernova type Ia, AM CVn stars and double degenerate).




As part of these lines of research I develop software tools to improve the way we research
these topics. You can find more information in
