My research has three main goals:
## Understand how cognition, particularly working memory, supports reading and spelling skills.

Working memory is very important in learning academic skills such as reading and spelling,
however, more information is needed to improve our understanding of how exactly these and other
cognitive abilities support us when we are learning these skills.

## Develop technology-based assessment tools to study this relationship

In order to improve our understand of how cognition supports reading and spelling skills we
need innovative tools that can help us gather more data, more efficiently, while also minimizing
the burden of researchers and research participants.

## Develop technology-based interventions that help improve basic reading and spelling skills.

A better understanding of how cognition supports reading and spelling skills will hopefully lead
to the development of better intervention tools that can gather data about the person's
performance and adjust themselves in order to match that person's needs. Just as in research,
these tools should minimize the burden of clinicians and students.

As part of these lines of research I develop software tools to improve the way we research
these topics. More information can be found in
